Description: deb-systemd-helper-new is the same as deb-systemd-helper, but extended for instantiated services
 The original deb-systemd-helper does not support instantiated services to install, remove or purge. (Have a look at https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=801822). This is a try to support normal and instantiated services like foo@.service. It does not replace the original, it only installes a new script "deb-systemd-helper-new" you can use instead of "deb-systemd-helper" in your packages, if you want to provide such services to be activated/deactivated on de/install-time with dpkg.
